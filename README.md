# expense-project
This is a expense documentation project

## Day 1
Added CLAUDE.md conventions, expense tracking domain model (Transaction, ExpenseCategory, Receipt, TransactionKind), MerchantNameClassifier, fixed TransactionDraft to match CLAUDE.md conventions, and JUnit 5 tests with 10 tests passing.

## Day 2
Added TransactionLedger repository with defensive copy, Optional-based findById, stream pipeline query findByMerchantAbove, and parameterized JUnit 5 tests. Refactored MerchantNameClassifier to add WARN logging on rejected input.

## Day 3
Added AmountThresholdClassifier and MccCodeClassifier strategy implementations, TransactionClassifiers factory class, ExpenseClassificationService with constructor-injected strategy, converted Transaction to a Java record, and Mockito test for strategy delegation.

## Day 4
Added exception hierarchy (ExpenseClassificationException base, UnrecognizedMerchantException, TransactionParseException subtypes), updated all classifier strategies to throw typed exceptions instead of returning fallbacks, switched ExpenseClassificationService to SLF4J + Logback with INFO and WARN logging, and added exception-path tests using AssertJ fluent assertions and a Logback ListAppender to verify log output.

## Day 5
Added RecurringChargeClassifier (4th strategy, TDD with 4 tests), TransactionTestDataBuilder fluent builder, wired JaCoCo with 70% branch coverage gate, and refactored existing tests to use the builder.
